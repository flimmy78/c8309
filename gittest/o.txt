nand - NAND sub-system

Usage:
nand info - show available NAND devices
nand device [dev] - show or set current device
nand read - addr off|partition size
nand write - addr off|partition size
    read/write 'size' bytes starting at offset 'off'
    to/from memory address 'addr', skipping bad blocks.
nand read.raw - addr off|partition [count]
nand write.raw - addr off|partition [count]
    Use read.raw/write.raw to avoid ECC and access the flash as-is.
nand erase[.spread] [clean] off size - erase 'size' bytes from offset 'off'
    With '.spread', erase enough for given file size, otherwise,
    'size' includes skipped bad blocks.
nand erase.part [clean] partition - erase entire mtd partition'
nand erase.chip [clean] - erase entire chip'
nand bad - show bad blocks
nand dump[.oob] off - dump page
nand scrub [-y] off size | scrub.part partition | scrub.chip
    really clean NAND erasing bad blocks (UNSAFE)
nand markbad off [...] - mark bad block(s) at offset (UNSAFE)
nand biterr off - make a bit error at offset (UNSAFE)
